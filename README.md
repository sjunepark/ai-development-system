# LLM IDE Dev

This repository contains the architecture and implementation for an agent-based workflow system designed for use with AI-powered code editors and IDEs (such as Windsurf, Cursor, etc).

## Overview

For a detailed description of the system, its agents, and the workflow patterns, please see:

- [system_architecture.md](./system_architecture.md)

This document explains:

- The roles of each agent (Requirements Agent, Knowledge Manager, Development Agent)
- The workflow patterns for feature development and knowledge capture
- The directory structure and communication principles
